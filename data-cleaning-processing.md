### Data cleaning steps

1. Download data from [OSF API](https://osf.io/user/9neka?tab=2)
- All campains in CAPA/NIHHIS Heat Watch project: 70 folders downloaded 

2. Download data from cities in nested folders
- `Oklahoma City`
    - Parent folder included both "Air Quality Results" and "Heat Results" sub-folders 
- `Mystic River (2021)`
    - Parent folder included both "Air Quality" and "Heat Watch" sub-folders 
- `UHI Assessments (2017, 2018)`
    - These cities contained "All Data" zip files
        - Richmond, VA (2017)
        - Washington, DC (2018)
        - Baltimore, MD (2018)
    - This city contained 3 separate zip files
    -   Portland, OR (2017)
- `Heat Watch Campaigns (2019)`
    - Added "Heat Watch" to folder name for each city
    - Some cities included an "All Data" folder
        - Boston, MA
        - Fort Lauderdale, FL
        - Honolulu, HI
        - West Palm Beach, FL
        - Worcester, MA
        - Yonkers, NY
    - Some cities had nested "Traverse Points" and "Surface Models" folders containing "Traverse Points" and "Area-wide" zip files
        - Los Angeles, CA
        - Oakland-Berkeley, CA
        - San Bernadino (CA)
        - Boise, ID
        - Sacramento (CA)
        - Victorville, CA
        - San Juan, PR (though these zip files were not in nested folders)
- `Heat Watch VFIC` (Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges)
    - Each folder contained two zip files, one for rasters and one for traverses
    - Added "Heat Watch {city}, VA" to folder name for each city
        - Abingdon
        - Arlington
        - Farmville
        - Harrisonburg
        - Lynchburg
        - Petersburg
        - Richmond
            - Also added "(2021)" to this Richmond file as there was an existing "Richmond, VA (2017)" file
        - Salem
        - Virginia Beach
        - Winchester

3. Remove non-US cities (5 folders removed)
- Freetown, Sierra Leone
- Nairobi Kenya 
- Rio de Janeiro
- Santiago Chile
- Vancouver

4. Rename city folders with &amp; or other characters besides spaces, hyphens, commas, and parens
- Heat Watch Bronx &amp; Manhattan (2021) 
    - Heat Watch Bronx and Manhattan (2021)
- Heat Watch Houston &amp; Harris County 
    - Heat Watch Houston-Harris County
- Heat Watch Johnson County &amp; Wyandotte County 
    - Heat Watch Johnson County and Wyandotte County
- Heat Watch San Jose &amp; Santa Clara
    - Heat Watch San Jose and Santa Clara
- Heat Watch Scranton &amp; Wilkes Barre
    - Heat Watch Scranton and Wilkes Barre
- Heat Watch Seattle &amp; King County
    - Heat Watch Seattle and King County

5. Unzip all files
- Most cities' files were unzipped programmatically 
- Some cities had nested zip files (i.e. within a `"All Data_Heat Watch {City}"` zip file), so manually unzipped them

6. Normalize file format
- Most common raster folder name format: `rasters_chw_{city_name}_{ID}`
    - Manually added underscores where missing from file names
- Most common raster file name format:
    - `{time}_hi_{scale}.tif` (`hi` == "heat index" data)
    - `{time}_t_{scale}.tif` (`t` == "temperature" data)
        - `scale`: f or c (most files use `f`)
        - `time`: am, af, pm (`am` == morning, `af` == afternoon, `pm` == evening)
- Some cities include "mean" files as well: `mean_hi.tif`, `mean_temp.tif`
    - Asheville
    - Brockton
    - Chicago
    - Iowa City and Cedar Rapids
    - Johnson County and Wyandotte County

    - Longmont

    - `{time}_heat_index_{scale}.tif`
        - Albuquerque
        - Houston-Harris County
        - Fort Lauderdale, FL
            - Unzipped files are nested in "All Data" folder -- need to re-org into `rasters` and `traverses` folders, but otherwise file names are consistent with others
        - Jersey City, Newark, and Elizabeth
        - Las Cruces
        - Los Angeles (both north and south files)
        - Roanoke
